* This is an example code for the algorithm described in
"Locality-constrained Linear Coding for Image Classification", CVPR 2010.

* To run the example code: 
1. Put Caltech101 image dataset in the "image" directory and
rename the folder with "Caltech101".
2. Download the Liblinear paackage for linear SVM.
3. Start from QX_LLC_Test_Main.m

* To train the codebook, one can simply use K-means. A pre-trained codebook is included in the package for Caltech101.

* For SIFT descriptor extraction, we use Prof. Lazebnik's matlab codes.
